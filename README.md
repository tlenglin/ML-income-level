Anomaly Detection Problem

Few data engineering due to a lack of statistical knowledge

Models tested : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, anomaly detection algorithm

Potential improvement : Better data engineering, Principal Component Analysis, better Decision Tree/Boosted Tree (since the Decision Tree appears to be the best algorithm for now) ?
